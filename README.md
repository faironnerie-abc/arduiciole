# What is the "arduiciole" project ?

We try to create some electronic devices, with the ability to flash with an high power led. 
These devices will spread a signal using XBee network, and try to reproduce the 
synchronization phenomena we can observe with fireflies. "arduiciole" is the melt of 
"arduino" and "luciole" (firefly in french).

Each of our arduiciole is tied up to an hellium balloon. We will try to produce between 10 
and 30 of them, for a national science event called "FÃªte de la science". This show will 
take place in the university library of Le Havre (76, France).
